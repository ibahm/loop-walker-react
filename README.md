<p align="center">A grid displaying the path taken from a set of directions in an array.</p>

# How it works
<b>Imagine you want to take a walk that returns you to where you started.</b>

The web application generates an array of directions that lets you do that. The grid represents an area with the green cell being your starting position ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200313599-7849c8eb-5009-4efb-b807-2a729ef78391.png). As the algorithm traverses the grid, the cell with a blue border represents your current position ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200313822-4d858e15-38ac-44db-8737-3d2316e69dce.png). Cells that have been visited become blue with their opacity increasing ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200314011-115126bc-b1fe-4e38-8f6d-fab0be769b89.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200314072-200f6b99-7b44-4ae7-9df0-42687c493e0b.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200314119-0d3a320a-22a7-449b-870c-9f21c0ca4812.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200314153-d7422ce7-66ef-42c4-9796-19ba4faf5eb3.png).

After it has completed the path, a set of directions relative to your starting location is displayed to you ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56367176/200314458-f058f2d9-f1b6-4021-82ac-3465bdbca91a.png).
